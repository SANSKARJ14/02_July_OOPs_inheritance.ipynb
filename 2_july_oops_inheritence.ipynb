    "\n",
    "inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows one class (called the subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties\n",
    "and behaviors of another class (called the superclass or base class).\n",
    "This means that a subclass can reuse and extend the characteristics and functionality of a superclass, forming a hierarchical\n",
    "relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "why it used\n",
    "\n",
    "A)Reuse of Code: Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing you to define common attributes and methods in a base class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "B)Abstraction and Modularity: Inheritance helps in creating abstract classes that define a common interface for a group\n",
    "of related classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "C)Polymorphism: it  allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, enabling more flexible\n",
    "and generic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Extensibility: Subclasses can add new attributes and methods or override the inherited ones to specialize the behavior\n",
    "of the base class. This enables you to adapt and extend existing code to accommodate specific requirements."

    "differences and advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: In Single Inheritance, a subclass can inherit from only one superclass. This means that a class\n",
    "can have one direct parent class from which it inherits attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single Inheritance tends to be simpler and easier to understand since there is a clear and\n",
    "linear hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoids Diamond Problem: It eliminates the \"diamond problem,\" a potential issue that can arise in Multiple Inheritance \n",
    "(explained below), where ambiguity occurs when a class inherits from two classes with a common ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: In Multiple Inheritance, a subclass can inherit from more than one superclass.\n",
    "This means that a class can have multiple parent classes from which it inherits attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reuse: Multiple Inheritance allows for more extensive code reuse, as a class can inherit from multiple sources,\n",
    "potentially reducing redundancy and promoting modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling Complex Relationships: It is useful for modeling complex relationships in the real world, where an object\n",
    "can possess attributes and behaviors from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Superclasses: The key difference is the number of superclasses a subclass can inherit from: one in Single Inheritance\n",
    "and multiple in Multiple Inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Single Inheritance is often considered simpler and less error-prone, making it a good choice for straightforward\n",
    "hierarchies. Multiple Inheritance can become more complex and may require careful design to avoid ambiguities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamond Problem: Multiple Inheritance can lead to the \"diamond problem\" when two or more superclasses have a common ancestor.\n",
    "This can result in ambiguity in method resolution, which must be addressed through various techniques,\n",
    "such as method precedence rules."
